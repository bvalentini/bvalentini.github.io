                <h1>Sole Proprietorship</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Setting up a sole proprietorship is a fast easy way to get your business started. There are few legal implications
            involved with setting up a sole proprietorship. In fact, if you are setting a business under your personal name, you do
            not have to register it. Instead, you can file your sole proprietor income under the self-employed section on your
            personal tax form.</p>
            

            <p>Although, sole proprietorships are quick and easy, they do not separate business legalities from the individual. Any
            penalties assessed to the business, impact the individual. Understanding your businessâ€™s scope is extremely important.
            If your business is prone to risk, then filing as a corporation may be the better option.</p>

            <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
            <p>As a sole proprietor, you are personally responsible for all aspects of the business, including debts and legal
            obligations. If the business faces a lawsuit or bankruptcy your personal assets may be
            at risk since there is no legal separation between you and the business. Assets like your home or personal savings can be impacted.</p>
            
            <p>Sole proprietors report business income on their personal tax returns and are taxed at individual rates. However, they
            can claim deductions and tax credits on eligible business expenses. Deductions such as office supplies, marketing, and travel,
            can help reduce the overall tax burden.</p>
            <h2>Steps to Register</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Business Name</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If using your legal name, registration may not be required.</li>
                        <li>If using a different name, check name availability with your provincial registry.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Register Your Business Name (If Required)</strong>

                <h1>Partnership</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Partnerships are a business structure in Canada that allow two or more owners. 
                Partnerships are similar to a sole proprietorship in the sense that the owners are personally liable for business debts and bankruptcy. 
                Often, this business structure raises more capital than a sole proprietorship because there are multiple owners responsible for the business. 
                Partnerships are a cheap and easy way to get your business launched. 
                However, some juridictions require partnerships to be re-registered every 5 or so years. 
            </p>
            <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
            <p>Partnerships are not separate business entities. Each owner runs the risk of impacting their personal assets such as homes and savings. 
                If sued or unable pay debts, all partners may be held accountable. 
                Partnerships must file an annual information return with the CRA. However, they do not pay a corporate income tax. 
                Rather, the business splits it's profits and losses between each partner. This income must be reported on each partners personal tax return. 
            </p>
            <h2>Steps to Register</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Business Name</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verify availability with the provincial registry.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Draft a Partnership Agreement (Optional but Recommended)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outline partner roles, profit sharing, dispute resolution, and exit strategies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Register Your Partnership</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Register with the appropriate provincial or territorial government.</li>

                <h1>Corporation</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A corporation is a business structure in Canada that provides limited-lilability. Meaning, the individual's personal assets are separate from the business entity.
                Corporations can cost more to set-up, ranging from $500-$1000+, depending on business specifications and associated legal fees. The process behind setting up a corporation can be a bit more complex because of the additional documentation.</p>
            <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
            <p>Corporations are their own business entity. The business structure allows for corporations to contract, own property, and undertake legal actions. Registering a corporation involves more legal steps. 
                These steps include: government registration, selecting a unique business name, appointing directors and officers, holding annual meetings, and maintaining accurate records.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the extra formalities, corporations are worth the investment. Safegaurding personal assets from corporate debt and bankruptcy can be a major relief for new entrepreneurs.
                However, there are exceptions to a corporations protection. If shareholders decide to personally garuntee loans or participate in illegal corporate activities, they may be subject to personal penalties.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Co-operatives is a business structure in Canada that uniquely allow "members" to own and control the business. Under a cooperative, members share responsibility for success and failures. 
                Shared responsibility can boost commitment, enhancing performance. However, the opposing side is also true. 
                This business structure can be viewed as a democracy. Every member has an equal voice in business operations. 
                Co-operatives typically have more access to capital because members contribute and share porfits. 
            </p>
            <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
            <p>Liability in a cooperative is typically limited to the amount of capital contributed by each member. 
                However, members may be held liable for their actions within the cooperative. Co-operatives can have various taxes and the process can be quite complex. 
                Seeking proffesional advice is recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
                Registering a cooperative varies by province, but typically involves filing articles of incorporation and registering with the appropriate government agency.
                Co-operatives may have to reigster with regulatory bodies depending on their industry or activities.

                    Location can position a business to gain recognition, talent, and new oppurtunities. 
                    New entrepreneurs typically face a variety of constraints that limit their freedom to choose certain business locations.
